		    I'm Dotz0cat.
		    I'm on varying places on the internet.
            I used to be around more,
            however over the past year or so I
		    have taken a step back.
            I have an interest in computers.
            I mostly enjoy programing.
            I also enjoy maintaining my current computer systems.
            I am a daily linux user.
            With my main distro of choice being Arch Linux,
            btw.
            I also have interests in electronics, photograghy, and anime.

		    As I have said I mostly enjoy programming.
            I usually work with the c programing language.
            I also have experience in c++.
            Lately,
            I have been writing some modern fortran.
            It's an interesting language to say the least.
            I also have some varying expirence in java, bash, python, and x86_64 assembly.
            Out of all of these languages,
            I most prefer C.
            Modern fortran is a close runner up.
            I usually post most of my code online on github.
            With Dotz0cat being my github username.
            Most of my code is under the GPLv3 liscens.
		    This is usually the best since it allows anyone to view and reuse my code.
            (along as it is complied with)
		    I also use it since I am a linux user.
            (GNU/Linux if you get into it)
            All of that is allowed by the of the liscense it uses.
            Amazing kernel, amzaing userland.
            Because of that I use the GPL too.

            I am now a graduate from the University of Central Arkansas.
            My degree is a bachlor's in Computer Science.
            I spent 2 / 3 years working on getting this degree.
            I started on it in the spring of 2023,
            right after graduating from
            <abbr title="Central Baptist College">CBC</abbr>
            in the fall of 2022.
            Funny thing, I only went down the street.
            If you know of how Conway is layed out,
            you know.
